        <h2>Experience</h2> 
        <p>I started using computer at the age of 3.I started thinking about programming for a living at an age of 8, then my Mom told how her computer crashed at work and a programmer came and fixed it in minute. My Mom also wanted me to become a coder. And so my journey started.</p>
        <p>At first I started by making games with Python like Ping-Pong, side scroller with collisions and similar. Then I started learning C# to make games with Unity. My Mom always aided me with money, so I could buy courses. Later while browsing for best sites to learn coding I found out about Treehouse. I started by checking out their Unity courses. But then I found web development courses, so I checked them out. I was fastinated with how easy and fun it is to create websites, and so here I am learning web development with the power of HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
